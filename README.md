Read more about this migration journey in [this blog post](https://rm3l.org/migrating-to-the-jamstack-with-gatsby-and-ghost-running-in-kubernetes/).

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* Backend
  * [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) provides the headless Content Management System (CMS). It runs in my own self-hosted [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster
* Frontend
  * [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) pulls data from the Ghost blog [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API, and builds this static site. Initial version has been created using the [gatsby-starter-ghost](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/TryGhost/gatsby-starter-ghost/) starter, then customized to include additional pages such as a [Portfolio](src/pages/portfolio.js) [React](https://reactjs.org/) component
* End-to-end tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test#readme)
* Continuously tested (CI) via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rm3l/rm3l.org/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
  * Specifically, once a deployment is successful in Netlify, a webhook triggers a [Kubeless function](https://kubeless.io/), which in turn requests a GitHub Workflow Run that tests the newly-deployed site
* Continuously deployed (CD) on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but I am considering migrating to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
  * Deploy previews of Pull Requests via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
* [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) & [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date


## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rm3l/rm3l.org my-jamstack-site && cd my-jamstack-site
   ```

2. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

4. Install YARN package manager

Follow the instructions here: https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

5. Install the project dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

6. Set up environment variables and customize the project

Copy the `.env.template` as a `.env` file in the repo and customize it accordingly:

   ```bash
   GHOST_API_URL=https://my.healdless.ghost.entrypoint
   GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY=my-ghost-blog-content-key
   CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID=my-cypress-project-id
   CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=my-cypress-record-key
   CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT=my-contact-form-endpoint
   ```
- `GHOST_API_URL` : the URL to the headless Ghost blog
- `GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY` : the Ghost Content API Key, which allows to pull data from a Ghost CMS
- `CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID` : the Cypress project Identifier
- `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` : the Cypress project record key, to use in a Cypress online dashboard
- `CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT` : the endpoint to call in the contact form

On build servers (CircleCI and Netlify), those are just defined as project-wide environment variables.

7. Change the site configuration

Edit the [src/utils/siteConfig.js](src/utils/siteConfig.js) file accordingly.

8. Start the development server

   ```sh
   gatsby develop
   ```

Gatsby `develop` uses the `development` config in `.ghost.json`.

## ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
    # Run a production build, locally
    gatsby build
   ```

2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   # Serve a production build, locally
   gatsby serve
   ```

Gatsby `build` uses the `production` config in `.ghost.json`.

## ðŸš¨ Testing

This repository contains few Cypress end-to-end tests that not only make sure the website renders as expected,
but also test accessibility (also known as [a11y](https://a11yproject.com/)).
To do so, the `test` commands spin up the Gatsby development server and run all the Cypress test specs against the former.
You can run the tests using the following command:

   ```sh
    # Runs the tests right away, with no user interaction
    yarn test
   ```

or :

   ```sh
    # Interactive test launcher: opens up a Cypress browser for interactively running the tests
    yarn test:open
   ```

## Deploying with Netlify

This contains 3 config files specifically for deploying with Netlify. A `netlify.toml` file for build settings, a `/static/_headers` file with default security headers set for all routes, and `/static/_redirects` to set Netlify custom domain redirects.

To deploy to your Netlify account, hit the button below.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/rm3l/rm3l.org)

You need however to leverage your own Ghost Content API Keys which allow Gatsby to communicate with your Ghost headless blog.
For this, I currently set [Netlify ENV variables](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables) for production builds instead.

Once deployed, I also set up a [Ghost + Netlify Integration](https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/netlify/) to use deploy hooks from Ghost to trigger Netlify rebuilds. That way, any time data changes (e.g., new post published) in the headless Ghost CMS, my website will rebuild on Netlify.
